Abstract
-----------

This paper extends a family of well-known stability theorems for monotone
economies to a significantly larger class of models. We provide a set of
general conditions for existence, uniqueness and stability of stationary
distributions when monotonicity holds. The conditions in our main result
are both necessary and sufficient for global stability of monotone
economies that satisfy a weak mixing condition introduced in the paper.
Through our analysis we develop new insights into the nature and causes of
stability and instability.
